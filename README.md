BlackBox
========
### About
BlackBox is a wargame styled partially around the [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/). It consists of a set of CTF-style Crypto Challenges that cover various common implementation flaws which can be leveraged to break cryptosystems based on otherwise secure primitives.  

The challenges were originally created as material for CSCI 4230/6230 - Cryptography and Network Security at RPI.
