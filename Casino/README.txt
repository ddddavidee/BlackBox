This challenge demonstrates why it is a bad idea to use PRNGs from important things carelessly. 

The PRNG used is the mersenne twister, and the source code is provided inside of mersenne.py.

Since this challenge uses a lot of code from previous servers, I've provided an example client 
"ex_client.py" that includes all the methods needed to solve this challenge.

Good luck, have fun. Email me if you have any questions/comments!
